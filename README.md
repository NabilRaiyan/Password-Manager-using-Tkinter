# Password-Manager-using-Tkinter
Making a password manager using JSON and Tkinter

In this project, I made a Password manager using Tkinter for GUI and JSON for data saving. Where you can add details for your new sign-up website or you can randomly generate any password for any website on which you want to sign up. Also, you can search for previous website details like the password or email you signed up for.
